## Overview
Java starter project based on gradle. It can be used as idea project template
 or be directly used to start a new java project.
 
## Logging Setup 
Project relies on logback logging framework. 
The [Logback Dependency] to logback-classic pulls logback-core.jar and slf4j-api.jar as well.

[Logback Configuration] is provided by logback.xml under the main resources.
By default, project uses 'debug' level logging which can be changed to other levels either in the file or by using a command live override.
 
## Unit Test Support

**JUnit 5 Integration**\
build.gradle is updated based on sample project at https://github.com/junit-team/junit5-samples/tree/r5.7.0/junit5-jupiter-starter-gradle

**Matcher**
    ```testImplementation 'org.hamcrest:hamcrest:2.2'```

[Hamcrest Dependency] is managed by gradle.
[AssertJ] is included to provide fluent assertion apis.
